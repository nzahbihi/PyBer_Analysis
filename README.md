# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
In this analysis, we investigated PyBer ride share data by city type, as defined as: rural, suburban, and urban. This was done in order to determine any trends among the city types and the fare for the rides. We then pulled data from the year 2019, from January through April. Once this analysis was completed, we identified disparities and provided recommendations to the business owner.

## Resources
* Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8.

## Results
Prior to identifying trends in the data, we first organized the data to present in a readable format, as shown below.

##### A summary of the data, sorted by city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) and the total number of rides, drivers, fares, as well as average fare per ride and driver.

The table shows that there is a large number of rides and drivers in urban areas, which are typically more densely populated. In contrast, in rural areas, which are less populated than urban and suburban cities, there are fewer total rides and drivers. This is also reflected in the total fares; with rural city types having fewer rides and drivers, there would be a smaller total amount compared to suburban and urban city types. However, we can also see that likely due to rural city types having fewer drivers, the average fare per ride is higher than suburban and urban city types. Consequently, on average, drivers earn more per ride in rural areas compared to suburban and urban cities.

With this data provided, we then created a multiple-line chart to get a visual idea of city types with the total weekly fare amount, from January 2019 through April 2019. This was done in order to visually perceive how fares vary from week to week.

##### A multiple-line chart that compares the total weekly fare amount, in USD, and the city types.

The chart above shows us that for these four months, urban cities had a high number of total fares per week, whereas rural cities had the lowest. We can also point out that there are some similarities, such as a spike in fare amount for each city type around the end of February. We can also see that there was a spike in fare amount for urban and rural cities in the first week of April. We can draw the conclusion that these fares are correlated with how populated urban, suburban, and rural cities are.

## Summary
Based on these results, we can provide three business recommendations to address the disparities among the city types.

* As shown in the table, there are fewer drivers in rural cities but a higher number of total rides. If PyBer were to expand more services into more rural areas, this could possibly increase demand for rides and bring in more drivers. As a result, it could also decrease the average fare per rider, making it more afforadable and accessible to users. Making PyBer's services more affordable and accessible to users could draw in more users, which could increase total revenue.

* Similar to the first recommendation, PyBer could also expand services into more suburban areas as well. There is also a demand for drivers based on the total amount of rides and the total amount of drivers in the table above. Expanding services and investing in advertising could draw more people to use PyBer.

* For urban areas, we can see that there is a much larger number of drivers than rides. While the average fare per rider is lower, the table also shows that the average fare per driver is low. PyBer could invest in advertising to the general population to use their services, which could increase the number of rides and average fare per ride and driver.

In conclusion, PyBer could expand more services into rural and suburban areas as a whole, to increase both the number of rides and drivers. PyBer could also invest in advertising for users to utilize their services more often, which in turn could increase the average fare per ride and driver. These recommendations could lead to PyBer increasing their total revenue.
